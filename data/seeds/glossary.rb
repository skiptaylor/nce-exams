Cocaine Anonymous (CA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Overeaters Anonymous (OA), Co-Dependents Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous are examples of other 12-Step programs which have developed after AA\'s original program. The basic principles of 12 step programs include the following:admitting that one cannot control one\'s addiction or compulsion; recognizing a greater power that can give strength; examining past errors with the help of a sponsor (experienced member); making amends for these errors; learning to live a new life with a new code of behavior; helping others that suffer from the same addictions or compulsions.
		<p>Alcoholics Anonymous 12 steps are the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
				<li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
				<li>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</li>
				<li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
				<li>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
				<li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
				<li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
				<li>Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
				<li>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
				<li>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
				<li>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
				<li>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.(Alcoholics Anonymous Publishing, Inc. NY, 1955)</li>
